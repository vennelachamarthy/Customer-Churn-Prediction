Customer Churn Prediction
Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using Machine Learning techniques.

Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer data
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Build and evaluate classification models

Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Joblib

Process
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
5. Model Saving with Joblib  

Results
- Achieved around XX% accuracy using Random Forest  
- Key churn factors: Contract Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges  

Future Improvements
- Add Power BI / Streamlit dashboard  
- Implement hyperparameter tuning
